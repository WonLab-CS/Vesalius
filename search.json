In silico spatial domain retrieval methods have been developed for spatial transcriptomics (ST) data assuming transcriptional similarity of neighboring barcodes. However, domain retrieval approaches with this assumption cannot work in complex tissues composed of multiple cell types. This task becomes especially challenging in cellular resolution ST methods. We developed Vesalius to decipher tissue anatomy from ST data by applying image processing technology. Vesalius uniquely detected territories composed of multiple cell types and successfully recovered tissue structures in high-resolution ST data including in mouse brain, embryo, liver, and colon. Utilizing this tissue architecture, Vesalius identified tissue morphology-specific gene expression and regional specific gene expression changes for astrocytes, interneuron, oligodendrocytes, and entorhinal cells in the mouse brain.},   year = {2022}, }"},{"path":"wonlab-cs.github.io/Vesalius/index.html","id":"vesalius","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Vesalius: Dissecting Tissue Anatomy from Spatial Transcriptomic Data","title":"Vesalius: Dissecting Tissue Anatomy from Spatial Transcriptomic Data","text":"Welcome Vesalius GitHub page!","code":""},{"path":"wonlab-cs.github.io/Vesalius/index.html","id":"what-is-vesalius-","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"What is Vesalius ?","title":"Vesalius: Dissecting Tissue Anatomy from Spatial Transcriptomic Data","text":"Vesalius R package decipher tissue anatomy embracing various image analysis techniques high-resolution ST data.

Vesalius provides 3 nornalization methods log_norm, SCTransform, TF-IDF. `use_counts` argument specifies count matrix used normalization. argument necessary use custom normalised count matrix. case, set argument name gave count matrix (see add_counts) `generate_embeddings` skip normalization use custom count matrix generate image embeddings. Note also possible add custom embeddings using add_embeddings function. Embeddings can created using custom set genes. genes can provided `features` argument form character vector. Note filter count matrix hence still access whole matrix downsteam analysis.","code":""},{"path":"wonlab-cs.github.io/Vesalius/reference/generate_embeddings.html","id":"ref-examples","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Examples","title":"Generate embeddings. — generate_embeddings","text":"","code":"if (FALSE) { # \\dontrun{ data(vesalius) # First we build a simple object ves <- build_vesalius_object(coordinates, counts) # We can do a simple run  ves <- generate_embeddings(ves) # maybe we want to try a different method # both will be stored in the object ves <- generate_embeddings(ves, dim_reduction = \"UMAP\")  } # }"},{"path":"wonlab-cs.github.io/Vesalius/reference/generate_spix.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Generate super pixels from ST — generate_spix","title":"Generate super pixels from ST — generate_spix","text":"Generate super pixels ST","code":""},{"path":"wonlab-cs.github.io/Vesalius/reference/generate_spix.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Generate super pixels from ST — generate_spix","text":"","code":"generate_spix(   vesalius_assay,   dimensions = seq(1, 3),   embedding = \"last\",   method = \"kmeans\",   col_resolution = 10,   compactness = 1,   scaling = 0.5,   threshold = 0.9,   index_selection = \"bubble\",   max_iter = 10000,   verbose = TRUE )"},{"path":"wonlab-cs.github.io/Vesalius/reference/generate_spix.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Generate super pixels from ST — generate_spix","text":"vesalius_assay vesalius_assay object dimensions numeric vector latent space dimensions use. embedding character string describing embedding used. method character string method used segmentation.
