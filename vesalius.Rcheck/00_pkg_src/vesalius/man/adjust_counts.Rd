\usage{
adjust_counts(coordinates, counts, throw = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{coordinates}{data frame containing coordinates after reducing 
resolution and compressing cooridnates}

\item{counts}{count matrix}

\item{throw}{logical - throwing warning message for unshared barcodes}

\item{verbose}{logical if progress messaged should be outputed.}
}
\value{
a count matrix with adjusted count values
}
\description{
adjust counts after reducing the resolution of the image tensor
or after filtering stray beads

This function will check the coordinate file to 
see if any barcodes have been merged together. If so,
the counts will be adjusted by taking the average count value accross 
all barcodes that have been merged together.
