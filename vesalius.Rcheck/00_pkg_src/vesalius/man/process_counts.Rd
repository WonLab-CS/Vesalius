\arguments{
\item{counts}{count matrix in the form of a sparse matrix}

\item{assay}{character string describing the assay that is being 
pre-processed in the vesaliusObject or vesalius_assay}

\item{method}{character string describing which normalisation method to use.
One of the following "log_norm", "SCT", "TFIDF", "none".}

\item{use_count}{string describing which counts should be used for the 
generating emebddings. Default = "raw".}

\item{nfeatures}{numeric describing the number of variable features to use.}

\item{min_cutoff}{only used when dimensionality reduction method is
LSI or LSI_UMAP cutoff for feature to be included in the 
VariableFeatures for the object.}

\item{verbose}{logical - progress messages outputed or not}
}
\description{
pre-process count matrices
}
\details{
The `use_count` argument specifies which count matrix should be used
for normalization. This argument is only necessary if you use a custom
normalised count matrix. In this case, set this argument to the name
you gave your count matrix (see \code{\link{add_counts}}) and
`generate_embeddings` will skip the normalization and use your custom
count matrix to generate image embeddings.
