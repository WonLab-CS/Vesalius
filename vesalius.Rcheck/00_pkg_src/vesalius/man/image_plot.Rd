  vesalius_assay,
  dimensions = seq(1, 3),
  embedding = "last",

\arguments{
\item{vesalius_assay}{a vesalius_assay object}

\item{dimensions}{which dimensions to use to generate image (see details)}

used for image generation.}

\value{
ggplot object
}
\description{
image_plot - plotting vesalius embeddings
}
\details{
Once you have generated your embeddings, 
you can visualise these embeddings using the \code{image_plot} function.
This function will generate a ggplot object representing the embedding 
image containing all pixels. You can select any dimension and in any 
combination you desire, however you can only select 1 or 3 dimensions 
to visualise at a time. This will either generate grey scale image 
or RGB images. 

This function is always applied to the active embedding. By default,
this is the last you generated. This means that you can also use
this function to visualise the effect if smoothing, equalization,
regularisation or segmentation. 

Please note that if you are using "louvain" or "leiden" for 
image segmentation, this will always generate grey scale images
even if you select multiple dimensions. "Kmeans" on the other hand 
will still produce RGB color segments.

The usage of this function remains the same in after any processing steps.

data(vesalius)
# First we build a simple object
ves <- build_vesalius_object(coordinates, counts)
# We can do a simple run 
ves <- build_vesalius_embeddings(ves)
# Plot 1st 3 PCs
p <- image_plot(ves)
