\description{
generate pixel tiles from punctual spatial assay coordinates
}
\details{
This function converts punctual coordinates into pixel tiles.
The first step is to filter outlier beads. Essentially removing any bead 
that lies outside of the main assay (seed \code{\link{filter_grid}}). If 
reqested the resolution of the image can be reduced by redudcing the 
relative distance between each coordinate pair 
(see \code{\link{reduce_tensor_resolution}}). Note that if the 
resolution is reduce all spatial indices are retained and counts
will be merged together (see \code{\link{adjust_counts}}). 

To create tiles, each coordinates is expanded by using Voronoi 
tesselation and each tile is raterised i.e "filled with pixel" 
(see \code{\link{rasterise}}). Prior to rasterisation, we
remove all tiles that are above an area threshold. These tiles
are artefacts of the tesselation algortihm that creates a "box"
around all points and uses this as a boudary to generate each tile.
They can also be generate by stray beads or holes in the data.
