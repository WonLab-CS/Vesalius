\description{
switch message output based in input
}
\details{
Essentially, all message types are listed in this giant switch.
The type defines what message you want to output. We select named
arguments from `...` and parse them when required.
Adding message is straight forward by simply using the template in 
other switch types. This also means that you can add and remove messages
without causing errors. While this might lead to dead code, better dead
code than buggy code with undefined functions...
