\description{
segment vesalius images to find initial territories

\details{
Applying image segmentation ensures a reduction in colour
complexity.

Vesalius provides 7 different methods for clustering colours and
reducing color complexity: **Kmeans**, **Louvain**, **Leiden**,
**slic**, **leiden_slic**, **louvain_slic**, and **som**

In the case of kmeans clustering the \code{col_resolution} argument
shows the number of colours that the images should be reduced to.
In this case, \code{col_resolution} should be an integer and
we suggest first looking at values between 3 and 20.

In the case of **leiden** and **louvain** clustering, the
\code{col_resolution} is the granularity of the clustering.
In this case, we suggest using values between 0.01 and 1 to start with.
We recommned uisng **louvain** clustering over **leiden** in
this context.

In the case of slic, the col_resolution define the number of starting
points used to generate super pixels. Depending on the number of
points there are in the assay, we suggested using 10% of the total 
number of points as starting point. 
For example, if you have  1000 spatial indices, you can set 
col_resolution to 100.

The optimal \code{col_resolution} will depend on your interest and 
biological question at hand. You might be interested in more or less
granular territories. Along with smoothing, the number of segments is
one way to control this granularity.
