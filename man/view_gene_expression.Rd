\description{
View gene expression in spatial omics data, in specific territories or
the expression of genes in a subset of cells.
}
\details{
Vesalius offers a plotting function that allows you to 
visualise gene expression. 

This function offers multiple options depending on what you provide.

1. Overall expression
You can visualise the overall expression pattern of a set of genes
by providing a vesalius_assay object containing counts.
If \code{as_layer} is set to FALSE this will show the expression at
each sptial index indivdually. If set to TRUE, this will show the
average expression on a gene in all territories present.

2. Expression in a territory
You can visualise the expression of a gene in an isolated territory.

3. Expression of cells in one or more territory
If you want to visualise the expression of specific cells, you can
parse a character vector containing your cells of interest. This
function will automatically subset the relevant territory data and
show the expression only in the spatial indeces hat are associated
with your cell type of interest. You can use this option to contrast
the expression of cells between territories by also providing which
territories you wish to contrast (`territory_1` and `territory_2`).
If only a single territory is provided, vesalius will only shows cell
in that territory.

If you provide more than one gene, `view_gene_expression` will return 
a ggarrange list containing all your genes as individual plots.
