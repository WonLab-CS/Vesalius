\usage{
signal_similarity(seed, query, method = "pearson", digits = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{seed signal}

\item{query}{query signal}
}
\value{
matrix with query as rows and seed as colmuns
}
\description{
compute the similarity between seed and query signals
}
\details{
Chunking cost and signal into smaller chunks to run the 
correlation score in paralell. There is room for improvement here.
First we could dispatch the longer list to future_lapply
but cannot know which one it is and we need to know that so we can 
subset the cost. 
Also the functions calls feature_cost which is a R wrapper for a 
c++ function (cost.cpp).
