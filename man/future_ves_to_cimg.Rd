\details{
using this as a way to run this section in parallel
way to slow otherwise. The back ground represents all pixels that are not 
part of the Spatial data but constiture the "rest" of the pixels in the image.
This tends to happen when you have a non rectangular assay that needs to be fitted
into a n * p or n * p * d array.
