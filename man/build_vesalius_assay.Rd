\arguments{
\item{coordinates}{data.frame in the format
barcodes, x, y.
Default is NULL. See details.}

\item{counts}{matrix, sparse matrix containing counts.
Default is NULL. See details.}

\item{image}{connection string or image array}

\item{assay}{character vector containing names of the assays
(see details).}

\item{scale}{character | numeric - if "auto", vesalius will compute
99 percentile of inter barcodes distance else provide a numeric value
describing distance between barcodes.}

\item{unit}{character - units of scale}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating if progress message should be
outputed or not.}

\description{
build a simple vesalius assay object from single count matrix and spatial
coordinate pair.
}
\details{
The vesalius_assay constructor allows you to create
partial or complete vesalius_assay objects.

Partial objects contain only the coordinates.

Complete objects contain both the counts and the coordinates.

The main purpose of using partial objects (or empty objects) is 
for you to be able to provide your own count matrix. 
This will be useful if you want to normalise your data in a 
way that is not provided by vesalius.

This approach of using your own data can also apply to embeddings.
If you have generated a set of latent space embeddings that you 
wish to use instead of those provided by vesalius, you can 
use the \code{\link{add_embeddings}} function. 


Along side this input data, you can provide a name 
to your assay. If none are provided, 
Vesalius will generate a set of names based on 
the default assay name "spatial_omics".

You can decide if you want to adjust the coordinates to the 
origin i.e remove unnecessary space or normalise the coordinates.
Norm is not recommened at the moment
