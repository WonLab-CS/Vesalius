\arguments{
\item{vesalius_assay}{vesalius_Assay object}

\item{method}{character describing barcode pooling method.
Currently, only "distance" availble}

\item{trial}{character string describing which segmentation trial
to use. Default is "last" which is the last segmentation trial used.}

\item{capture_radius}{numeric - proportion of maximum distance between
barcodes that will be used to pool barcodes together (range 0 - 1).}

\item{global}{logical - If TRUE, territories will be numbered across all
colour segments. If FALSE, territories will be numbered within each colour
segment.}

\item{min_spatial_index}{integer - minimum number of barcodes/spots/beads
required in each territory}

\item{verbose}{logical - progress message output.}

\description{
isolating territories from vesalius image segments
}
\details{
Image segments can be further subdivided into 2D
seperated territorires. This is accomplished by pooling barcodes
that are associated with a colour cluster into territories based on the
distance between each barcode.

First, \code{isolate_territories} considers the maximum distance
between all beads. The \code{capture_radius} will define which 
proportion of this distance should be considered.

Second, a seed barcode will be selected and all barcodes that are within the
capture distance of the seed barcode with be pooled together. This process
is then applied on barcodes that have been selected in this manner. The
process is repeated until all barcodes have been pooled into a territory.
If there are still barcodes remaining, a new seed barcode is selected and the
whole process is repeated. NOTE : Territory isolation is applied to each
colour segment independently.

If a territory does not contain enough barcodes, it will be pooled into the
isolated territory. This territory contains all isolated territories
regardless of colour cluster of origin.
