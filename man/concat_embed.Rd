\usage{
concat_embed(seed, query, dimensions, norm_method, dim_reduction, signal)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{vesalius_assay object of the first modality}

\item{query}{vesalius_assay object of the second modality}

\item{dimensions}{int - number of gray scale images to create}

\item{norm_method}{string describing which normalisation 
method to use. One of the following "log_norm", "SCT", "TFIDF", "raw"}
