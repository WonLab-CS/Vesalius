\arguments{
\item{query_signal}{processed query signal from query assay}

\item{seed_signal}{processed seed signal from seed assay}

\item{k}{int size of niche (knn)}

\item{radius}{0.05 proportion of max distance to use as radius for 
neighborhood}

\item{depth}{graph path depth to condsider for neighborhood.}

\item{batch_size}{int number of points in each query batch}

\item{mapping}{exact mapping or div (divide and conquer)}

\item{verbose}{logical - out progress to console}

\item{query}{vesalius_assay object}

\item{custom_cost}{matrix - matrix of size n (query cells) by p (seed cells)
containing custom cost matrix. Used instead of vesalius cost matrix}

\item{seed}{vesalius_assay object}

\item{overwrite}{logical - if custom_cost is not NULL, should this matrix
be added to the vesalius matrix or should it overwrite it completely.}
