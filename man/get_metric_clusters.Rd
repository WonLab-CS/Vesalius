\description{
Cluster query cells based on which reference cells they tend to mapped to
}
\details{
Once we have mapped cells between sample, we can identify which cells
tend to map to the same group of cells. To achieve this, we first create a 
cost matrix that will serve as a basis to find similar-mapping instances.
The cost matrix can be constructed from any cost matrix that was used during the 
mapping phase. 
Next, for each query cell we extract the top_nn cells in the reference with lowest
cost. Using the ordered index as a character label, we compute a jaccard index 
between overlapping labels. Query cells with a high jaccard index tend to map 
to the same reference cells. We then use the reciprocal to define a distance between
cells and cluster cells based on this distance.
The same approach is used for every clustering method provided. 
This function will add a new column with the metric clustering results.
